      <p> Missing someone ?? </p>
      <p> It's really cheating Prasuna..., you took 50% of everyone with you. You are not supposed to be sad. You must eat healthy food, and be happy all the time. </p>

	    <p> Your family members or whoever you may feel missing are your strengths. Please don't make them as your weakness. I mean... their absence must not hurt you. </p>
