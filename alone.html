      <p> Feeling alone ?? Why ?? </p>
      <p> The moment I knew that you're feeling alone, I started my journey immediately (running) to reach you. But dogs felt as I'm a thief and started running 
        behind me. Oh my god..... I increased my speed as dogs, their owners are running behind me. </p>

      <p> Once you open the door.... Your family members, Everyone are infront of you. Then instead of arranging everything to us, you feel
        better if we quit (Not about your family members). </p>
      <p> You'll never feel alone again. <img src = "naughty1.jpg" width="50" height="50" /> </p>

                                <br/> 
	    <p> Don't feel alone.... if we left you alone, it means we believe that YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THINGS ALL BY YOURSELF. </p>
