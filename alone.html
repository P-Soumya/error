      <p> Feeling alone ?? Too sad </p>
      <p> The moment I knew that you're feeling alone, I started my journey immediately via running to reach you. But dogs felt as I'm a thief and started running 
        behind me. Oh my god..... I increased my speed as dogs, their owners are running behind me. </p>
      <p> Once you open the door.... Your family members, I, Dogs, Owners are infront of you. Then instead of arranging everything to us, you feel
        better if we quit (Not about your family members). </p>
      <p> You'll never feel alone again </p> 
        
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
      <p> If you get a thought that you're alone.... it means you're leisure. So, get busy with something and be happy </p>
